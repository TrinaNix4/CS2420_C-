# Language Basics - Variables

- C++ is a strongly typed language
  - variables can hold only certain types of values 

  - must declare variables before they're used; cannot change type 

  - fundamental types built into the language 
  - numbers, boolean, single characters 

  # User defined types 

  - strings , dates, business objects

  - structs and classes let you define types; 

  # user defined types are full participants in the language  - this sets C++ apart from other languages
